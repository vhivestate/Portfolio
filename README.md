# My-Portfolio
## Purpose
The purpose of this Portfolio is to showcase the skills I have for potential employers.</br>
Throughout bootcamp I will continue to add to this portfolio and make it look better as I learn new skills. </br>
I included a navigation section that includes an about, contact, and resume button. In my resume I included my work expierence that does not corrlelate to coding. As I go through the course I will also update my skills in my resume! </br>
I made sure that my portfolio webpage is responsive. </br>
Whenever the user selects an image in my progects section they are taken to those websites. </br>
Thank you for checking out my webpage!
